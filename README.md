# AIproject
A regression and classification app

## Abstract
This is a app builded with the python package streamlit.
It includes 2 machine learning model: classification with Adaboost classifier and regression with linear regressioin.

The dataset is from kaggle:"kaggle datasets download -d ydalat/lifestyle-and-wellbeing-data"

We found that the daily stress level is not easy to evaluate, so we build a classification model to predict the possible
stress level of the user, and use the prediction to calculate the Work Life Balance score.

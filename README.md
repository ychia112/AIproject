# AIproject
A regression and classification app

## Abstract
This is an app builded with the python package streamlit.
It includes 2 machine learning model: classification with Adaboost classifier and regression with linear regressioin.

The dataset is from kaggle:"kaggle datasets download -d ydalat/lifestyle-and-wellbeing-data"
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ydalat/lifestyle-and-wellbeing-data

We found that the daily stress level is not easy to evaluate, so we build a classification model to predict the possible
stress level of the user, and use the prediction to calculate the Work Life Balance score.
 
Try it with your own data and see the prediction result!
